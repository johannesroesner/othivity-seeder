# Othivity Seeder

*Othivity Seeder* is a tool designed to populate our  [Othivity WebApp](https://github.com/johannesroesner/othivity) with data for demonstration purposes. It generates and inserts sample data into the application's database, allowing users to explore and interact with the app's features without needing to input their own data.

## Data and Credits
The address data used by *Othivity Seeder* is sourced from the [Amtliches Straßenverzeichnis Regensburg](https://www.regensburg.de/fm/121/amtl_verzeichnisse_stadtbezirke_nach_strassen.pdf) project. Zipcodes where gathered via [OpenPLZ API](https://www.openplzapi.org/de/). The other sample data e.g. names, activity titles, and descriptions are generated with AI.
